        <h1>URW DIN vs. Interstate</h1>
             <h2>History of each typeface</h2>

			 <h3>Interstate</h3> <!-- Older typeface first, please. -->
             <p>Interstate is a sans-serif font designed by Tobias Frere-Jones during the period 1993–1995 and was certified by the Font Bureau. This typeface is an interpretation of Highway Gothic, which was the official typeface for US Federal Highway Administration for decades. Due to its legibility, wide spacing, and bold weights, it is best suited to be used as a display font for printing, such as signage. However, Interstate can be used for textual content location in print and web.</p>
             
			 <h3>URW DIN</h3> <!-- Second typeface here. -->

             <p>URW DIN is a sans-serif font that was designed by Volker Schnebel and published by URW Type Foundry in 2017. DIN is an acronym for Deutsches Institut für Normung: German Institute for Standardisation. It was based on the original German Standards Organization font number DIN 1451, which was commissioned for use in German public administration and signage. In addition, URW DIN originally was used on road signage in Germany due to its legibility and uncomplicated design. Today, URW DIN has a broad spectrum of uses, including logos of large companies like DirecTV and Forever21. The typeface contains 48 styles (including 24 different weights and their corresponding italics) and is supported in 21 languages.</p>

			    
			<h2>Comparison</h2>

			<h3>Similarities</h3>
			<p>Both Interstate and URW DIN typefaces are sans-serif typefaces. The two font families are spaced widely and share a large x-height which is good for e-publishing and overall readability. They both have similar crossbar width, open counters, bowl shape and size, and eye shape and size. Also, the typefaces were originally created for road signs.</p>

             <h3>Differences</h3>

             <p>In general, the Interstate typeface is more circular while the URW DIN typeface is more square. Interstate has angled ascenders and descenders which create a sharp and edgy feeling, while DIN has a 90° or flat end. Also, for some of the characters with descenders, like the letter “g” or “y”, the tail for Interstate is much shorter and has less curve. In addition, the tittle for “i” and “j” on Interstate is circular while on URW DIN, it is square. As for punctuation, the rounded punctuation of the Interstate typeface contrasts the rectangular punctuation of the UWR DIN typeface. </p>
