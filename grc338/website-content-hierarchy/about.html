                <h2>About</h2>
                    <p>Established in 2015, Poppy's Patisserie opened along Avila Beach on the sunny central coast of California. Poppy's Patisserie offers breakfast and brunch with authentic French pastries and recommended quality choice drinks. The aroma of sugar, butter, and roasted coffee wafts out the door, attracting people near and far.</p>
                    <p>Over the years, many of our creations have become iconic, including our signature flaky Croissant Au Beurre, Pain Au Chocolat, and Pistachio and Raspberry Éclair. Poppy's Patisserie expanded into a spot where locals and tourists alike come to enjoy fresh pastries.</p>
                    <p>Though we've become celebrated throughout the West Coast, Poppy's Patisserie continues to value exceptional hospitality and customer service, and is committed to serving our local communities by supporting small businesses, charities, schools, and bake sales. Whether you’re planning a trip to our hometown of Avila Beach or want to indulge in some sweets at your next gathering, we’re excited for you to enjoy some of our favorite creations.</p>
